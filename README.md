# Monte-Carlo-Method üêç 
Monte Carlo simulation algorithm for stocks and financial instruments with Python, Numpy and Matplotlib.

# Contributions
Monte-Carlo-Method is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

# Detailed documentation of code in the case it is unclear 
- the parameters of the function get_simulation being "ticker" and "name" can be manipulated for your desired ticker and name of the stock
- Pandas DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). 
- Pandas datareader is a sub package that allows one to create a dataframe from various internet datasources
- Adjusted close is the closing price after adjustments for all applicable splits and dividend distributions.
- Pandas dataframe.pct_change() function calculates the percentage change between the current and a prior element. This function by default calculates the percentage change from the immediately previous row.
- .mean() is a function to calculate the mean. 
- .var() is a function to calculate the variance.
- drift is the change of the average value of the stock over time. 
- .std() is a function to calculate the standard deviation. 
- t_intervals is the projected amount in days
- iterations is the amount of simulations ran
- daily_returns is a creation of random future values for each day. This is created by a random percentage value along with the previously defined variables as seen in the code. 
- S0 indexes the last row of the data
- np.zeros_like(daily_returns) is created as an array of zeros of the same shape of the daily_returns array, we can then append actual values. 
- price_list[0] = S0 is the initialization of the data at the start point


# Some maths behind the program

ST = S0e^((Rf-d-(œÉ^2)/2)T+œÉ*sqrt(TZ)) 

The definitions for each of the variables in this formula are:

- ST: Simulated future stock price.
- S0: Beginning stock price (e.g., as of the grant date).
- e: The mathematical constant e (~2.72, i.e., the base of the natural logarithm).
- Rf: The risk-free interest rate based on zero-coupon U.S. Treasuries (the ‚Äúdrift‚Äù).
- d: The dividend yield (if applicable).
- œÉ: Annual volatility.
- T: The term of the award, from the grant date to the end of the applicable period.
- Z: Normally distributed random variable (Z-score); for simplicity, one can think of ‚ÄúZ‚Äù as a random number that changes for each simulation.
